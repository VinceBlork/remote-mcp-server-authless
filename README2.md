Master Control Program (MCP)
Overview
Welcome to my personal Master Control Program (MCP) repository! This repository serves as a central hub for various personal Python scripts and command-line tools that I develop to automate tasks, generate content, or simply make my daily workflow more efficient. Think of it as my personal toolkit for digital tasks.

How to Use
To get started with the MCP and run its tools, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the Repository
First, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/MasterControlProgram.git
cd MasterControlProgram

(Remember to replace YourGitHubUsername with your actual GitHub username.)

2. Run a Simple Tool (e.g., Daily Affirmation Generator)
Many of the scripts in this repository are self-contained and can be run directly. For example, to run the Daily Affirmation Generator:

Navigate to the tool's directory:

cd my_tools/

Ensure the affirmations.txt file exists:
This tool relies on a affirmations.txt file in the same directory for its content. Make sure you have this file present and populated with affirmations (as provided in the repository).

Make the script executable (if necessary, on macOS/Linux):

chmod +x affirmation_generator.py

Run the script:

./affirmation_generator.py

This will output a random positive affirmation to your console.

Tools Included
Daily Affirmation Generator
Description: A simple Python script (affirmation_generator.py) that provides a daily dose of positivity. It randomly selects and prints a positive affirmation to your console.

Dependency: This tool reads its affirmations from affirmations.txt, a plain text file where each line is a different affirmation. This allows for easy customization of the affirmations without modifying the script itself.

Future Plans
Add more utility scripts for common development tasks.

Explore integrating with APIs for external data fetching.

Implement simple CLI interfaces for more complex tools.

Develop tools for personal finance tracking.
